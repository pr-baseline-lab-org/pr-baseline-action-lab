# PR Baseline action

> Keep open pull requests current with a movable baseline on the base branch, reported through commit statuses.

**This repository is generated.** It mirrors [`actions/pr-baseline`](https://github.com/mawesomedev/mawesome/tree/main/actions/pr-baseline) in [mawesomedev/mawesome](https://github.com/mawesomedev/mawesome) with the bundled `dist/` and a `release.json` naming the release added; open issues and pull requests there. Full documentation lives in the package's [docs](https://github.com/mawesomedev/mawesome/tree/main/packages/pr-baseline/docs).

A repository-wide change lands on the base branch and every open PR branched before it keeps passing CI on stale code. This action marks that commit with a git ref under `refs/baselines/`, the **baseline**, and stamps open PRs with a commit status: `success` when the PR's head contains the baseline, `failure` when it does not. Require the status in the base branch's ruleset and stale PRs must merge or rebase before they can land. The baseline moves forward only by intent: a workflow dispatch, a merged PR carrying a label, or a push touching marker paths.

## Usage

One workflow, two jobs, both calling this action. Copy it, replace every `BASE` with your base branch, pin the action and `actions/checkout` to commit SHAs, and adjust `PR_BASELINES`.

The `refresh-pr-status` job never checks out code: the head SHA comes from the event. The `refresh-pr-statuses` job's treeless, full-history checkout gives the action the commit graph without trees or blobs, and the action fetches what else it needs itself, authenticated with the same token.

## Modes

`mode: auto` (the default) maps the event to a command:

| Event                                           | What runs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pull_request_target`, any type but `closed`    | `refresh-pr-status` on the PR head, status written. The supported path for fork PRs.                                                                                                                                                         |
| any event, run triggered by Dependabot          | The workflow token is read-only: a PR is evaluated without writing, a move or refresh is skipped. The schedule makes the move, but nothing stamps that commit under the default scope: use a custom token, or a `scope: unstamped` backfill. |
| `pull_request_target` type `closed` and merged  | `move-baseline` (a labeled merge moves its baseline); the refresh that follows is suppressed when no baseline ref changed.                                                                                                                   |
| `pull_request_target` type `closed`, not merged | Nothing, with a notice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `pull_request`                                  | `refresh-pr-status`; with the workflow token the status is written only for a same-repository PR not triggered by Dependabot.                                                                                                                |
| `merge_group`                                   | `refresh-pr-status` on the merge group's head when its base is the configured branch; otherwise the `other-bases` rule applies.                                                                                                              |
| `push` to the base branch                       | `move-baseline` (path markers, merges made without a PR event); the refresh that follows is suppressed when no baseline ref changed.                                                                                                         |
| `schedule`                                      | Non-forced `move-baseline` followed by a refresh that runs whether or not anything moved, which is the recovery net.                                                                                                                         |
| `workflow_dispatch`                             | The same as `schedule`; the template's `mode` input passes `move-baseline` with `force` or `refresh-pr-statuses` explicitly.                                                                                                                 |

Explicit modes (`refresh-pr-status`, `refresh-pr-statuses`, `move-baseline`, `report`) take the inputs as given; `refresh-pr-status` then needs `sha`. One rule still comes from the event: a pinned `mode: move-baseline` on a base-branch push or a merged `pull_request_target` skips its refresh when no baseline ref changed, exactly as `auto` does, so pinning the mode does not bring back a refresh on every push.

`token` defaults to the workflow's own token. With a GitHub App token, pass `creator` (the App's `<slug>[bot]` login); with a personal access token the creator is resolved from the token.

| `scope`           | The scope a refresh applied; `all` whatever was asked when a baseline is off the base branch, after a forced move, or with a custom reporter.                                                                                  |

| `paused`          | Whether a refresh stopped on a budget having written something, with nothing failed or deferred (`true` or `false`). The step stays green unless something else fails it; a run at the same scope continues where it left off. |
| `summary`         | JSON summary of the run, per-PR results capped to stay under the output size limit.                                                                                                                                            |
| `results-file`    | Path of a JSON file with the uncapped per-PR results of a refresh, for an upload step.                                                                                                                                         |

<!-- outputs:end -->

Every run, including a skip or an error, sets every output and writes a step summary. `summary` is a JSON string a following step can turn into a comment or a check run; `results-file` holds the uncapped per-PR results of a refresh for an artifact upload.

## Permissions

| Job                   | `contents` | `statuses` | `pull-requests` |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| `refresh-pr-status`   | read       | write      |                 |
| `refresh-pr-statuses` | write      | write      | read            |

Require the status context (`PR baseline` by default) in the base branch's ruleset only, with the source matching the token. The baseline refs live under `refs/baselines/`, which no clone fetches and no ruleset covers: whoever has `contents: write` can move them, and the tool only ever fast-forwards them. The package docs cover [permissions](https://github.com/mawesomedev/mawesome/blob/main/packages/pr-baseline/docs/permissions.md), [rate limits](https://github.com/mawesomedev/mawesome/blob/main/packages/pr-baseline/docs/rate-limits.md), [edge cases](https://github.com/mawesomedev/mawesome/blob/main/packages/pr-baseline/docs/edge-cases.md) and the [runbook](https://github.com/mawesomedev/mawesome/blob/main/packages/pr-baseline/docs/runbook.md).

## Support

GitHub.com is the primary target. GitHub Enterprise Server works through the runner's `GITHUB_API_URL`, `GITHUB_GRAPHQL_URL` and `GITHUB_SERVER_URL`; the action is reachable through GitHub Connect or a local mirror. The action runs on the `node24` runtime and needs git 2.45 or newer on the runner for git ancestry.
